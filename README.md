How to run the json flattener

Download the program as a zip from github
Open it in an IDE of your choice.
Run the program (the main file is jsonflattener.java).
Enter the filename of the json file you want to flatten.
  If you want to use test on one of the two files already in the folder, simply enter 
  "src/main/java/com/github/wnameless/json/resources/test.json" or "src/main/java/com/github/wnameless/json/resources/test.json2" (without quotation marks)
  in the command line. 
  If you want to use your own file, please add it to the resources folder, and change the suffix of the command from line 9, e.g:
  "src/main/java/com/github/wnameless/json/resources/your-file-here.json"
  The command line prints out the json flattened json object
